These colors were intentionally chosen to complement the overall aesthetic of the game and create a visually engaging user experience that captures the essence of the game's theme.

### Typography

# fonts
Roboto and Josefin Sans were the fonts chosen, and by using them, the letters were blockier, simpler to see, and more reminiscent of video games, particularly the Roboto font, which has a more cartoonish appearance.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to design the main game screen.
