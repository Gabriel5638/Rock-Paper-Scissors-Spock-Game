![rpsls](assets/readme-files/rpsls.png)
![space](assets/readme-files/space.jpeg)
* The website's visuals were carefully curated to align with the game's overarching theme of space and neon, inspired by the iconic Star Trek character, Spock. The selection of images sourced from the Pexels website showcases this theme and contributes to an immersive gaming experience that transports users into the game's world. Through the incorporation of these images, the website successfully captures the essence of the game's space-themed elements, offering users a visually engaging and memorable experience.

![home page](assets/readme-files/home.png)

* The selection of button colors, which comprise green, red, orange, purple, and grey, was carefully curated to ensure they would stand out amidst the dark background. These colors were intentionally chosen to complement the overall aesthetic of the game and create a visually engaging user experience that captures the essence of the game's theme.

### Typography

Roboto and Josefin Sans were the fonts chosen, and by using them, the letters were blockier, simpler to see, and more reminiscent of video games, particularly the Roboto font, which has a more cartoonish appearance.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to design the main game screen.

## Buttons
![buttons](assets/readme-files/buttons-rpsls.png)
- The buttons are clickable and provide the user with a unique sound for each selection: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or Spock. After the user clicks the "play again" button, the buttons will bounce to signify the beginning of a new round.

## Gifs

![spock gif](assets/readme-files/star-trek.gif)

 - GIFs were used for both the desktop and mobile versions. The GIFs are displayed when a player reaches 6 points on the desktop version, congratulating the winner and showing a funny GIF of the actors from Star Trek, including Spock himself. The GIFs appear at random, users gets a different one each time they win. This adds replayability to the game, so players can discover new GIFs with each playthrough.
